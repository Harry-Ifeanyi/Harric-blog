# Harric-blog
Wepapp/Frontend project with React.Js

This is a simple webapp I created when I felt like trying how to fetch data and send Request to a JSON server, 
I created my own simple local server and stored some data in it. After watching my json file, it being able to respone to simple Request like POST, DELETE, & DELETE ID.

Basically, It a blog app where you can create a blog, delete a blog, view blog list.

PS: The React routing version in this project is v5
